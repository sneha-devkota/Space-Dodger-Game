# Space Dodger Game

## Overview
This project aims to create an engaging browser-based game where players control a spaceship to dodge falling asteroids using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tracks the player's score and ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.

## Features
- Dynamic asteroid generation with varying speeds and sizes
- Real-time collision detection and game over handling
- Score tracking and display

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structuring the game interface
- CSS for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity

## Usage
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship.
- Dodge the falling asteroids to increase your score.
- The game ends if your spaceship collides with an asteroid.

P.S. Don't mind the circle enclosing the spaceship and asteroid; it's the boundary box. I couldn't make it so that the game stops when the icons crash, unfortunately, but I'm still working on it!ðŸ˜Š
